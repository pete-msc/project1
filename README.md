For months now I've been wanting to create a personal website for myself. I had envisioned a site where I could explore ideas and topics I'm interested in and pratice the craft of writing. I read a lot and I'm constantly taking notes, so I thought this could serve as a more structured venue for me to synthesize and then share my thoughts with people.
The key here is sharing - I want this site to serve as a place where I can share a bit of my self, my interests, and my work with people. I'm planning on working in Venture Capital after Kellogg. I've been recruiting for VC jobs all year and I've learned that I desparately need a nice website I can point people toward to get a sense of me, what I'm interested in, what work I've done, how I think about investing - and, ultimately, how I view the world. This would be tremendously helpful.
One of the main reasons I took this class was to be able to learn how to build a nice website like this for myself. I hope to take this beta and make it into an awesome, real website in the near future.
