            It probably started with karate. I wanted to be the White Power Ranger, so for my fifth birthday I begged my mom for lessons. Nine years of training and competing later I earned my black belt. In high school, it was guitar: listening to dad play, visiting the guitar shop and feeling a world open, obsessing over Les Pauls, imitating Jimmy Page until my fingertips were worn raw. Poker was more recent – playing online for hours, studying hand histories, making more money at poker than at my analyst day job. I’ll never forget walking home from the casino at four in the morning with $6,000 stuffed in my sock, heart pounding because I’d never held so much money in my life. I’m relentless. I throw myself into each pursuit with intent, seeking out what will push some latent part of me to grow.

            For as long as I can remember I’ve been a serial pursuer – I follow my curiosity, immersing myself, driving to understand the depths of a subject, until interest sparks and drives me anew. I’ve delved into hiking, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, meditation. Reading has been lifelong. It started with Harry Potter, but like everything else I dove deeper: Hemingway, with the strait all-knowing voice, I narrated my life in his diction; reading David Foster Wallace, like a tuning fork in perfect resonance with my mind. I built myself on books. The Big Short, Black Swan, and Freakonomics were how I processed the Financial Crisis when I started college in ’09. My reading is what ultimately propelled me to leave behind pre-med, a family of doctors, and pursue economics.

            My interests are not phases but evolutions – all of them have and continue to shape me and how I contribute to the world. My most meaningful relationships were built chasing these pursuits; it’s how I become a better person and connect with others. These immersions are not merely hobbies and they are not casual: poker taught me to think systematically about risks and make pressure decisions in the face of uncertainty; Infinite Jest formed my view that life is about empathy. They are not meandering or fleeting: obsessions with data and analytics drove me to build a data-focused business, the most formative experience of my professional life. I feel alive exploring the whole expanse of a subject and internalizing it somehow. I relish the direction and gratification it gives me. What matters to me most is feeding this curiosity, continually evolving, and growing past the boundaries of who I was yesterday.

            While I was head of macroeconomic research, my curiosity drove me to reach beyond my role, follow my passion for data, and refocus the business at my previous firm (MPF). I watched closely as new, information-rich sources of data were emerging thanks to the digitization of our world over the past decade. I became engrossed; massive, messy data that previously couldn’t be tapped could now be mined for insights thanks to better computing power and the blossoming of machine learning and other analytical techniques. In our industry, commissions to traditional equity research providers were declining. Through my research, I could see our customers were moving to data-based investing strategies, and I knew this was my opportunity jump in; I had the drive to take my obsession and build something with it. MPF’s specialty is gathering ground-level information on company trends, so I thought our proprietary data could be sellable. Using Python skills I had taught myself earlier in my immersion into data analytics, I tested our data for predictive value. I began working with funds to analyze and design trading strategies around our data and it became clear to me that I could monetize our unique product.

            Less than a year later I have hired a team and brought in our first customer. Most importantly, I have gotten my first taste of entrepreneurship and am captivated by it. The entrepreneurial aspect of business demands and feeds the same curiosity that has always been core to who I am: you can never settle, you must constantly evolve and innovate to create value. It is clear to me that the influential businesses of the future will be built with data and analytics at their center. I plan to be a part of this revolution and found my own company, joining the ranks of innovative data-driven businesses like Stitch Fix, Amazon, Netflix and Google.
